    "selected_idea_id": "idea_1",
    "summary": "This workflow is designed to systematically test the hypothesis that Janus CrXY monolayers exhibit enhanced and tunable magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) under biaxial strain due to broken inversion symmetry and strain-modified orbital hybridization. The asymmetric structure of Janus materials (CrSSe, CrSTe, CrSeTe) breaks inversion symmetry, which can enhance spin-orbit...",
    "methods": "Spin-polarized DFT+U with van der Waals corrections (DFT-D3) as specified. Use the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method in VASP. For exchange-correlation, employ the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional with Hubbard U correction (Ueff = U - J) applied to...",
    "risks": "Moderate to high risks. Key risks include: 1) Computational cost: DFT+U with SOC and strain sweeps is resource-intensive (weeks of CPU time). 2) Parameter sensitivity: MAE and Tc depend heavily on U value and k-point convergence; inaccurate U can lead to...",
